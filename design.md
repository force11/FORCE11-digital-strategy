### Comments and tasks for FORCE11

#### Comment

Since we are rebuilding site - We should address the COVID situation and have an '18 month COVID strategy' and assess how our offline activities can be accommodated online.

#### Questions and tasks

   * Membership and site use over time: Looking to see how F11 addresses Global South and provide future benchmarking process and for other membership analytics.
     * Request: Admin access to Google analytics mrchristian001@gmail.com to add other people and fully admin.
     * Request: Someone make a chart of times of year when conference and FSCI happen as far back as possible in spreadsheet.
     * Request: Access to Mailchimp.
     * Request: Mandy do you have any older membership reporting.
  * Request: Need a new email address webmaster@force11.org with forward to simon.worthington@tib.eu
  * Personas: Request: Want someone to look at them and give comment, approve.
  * Comparators: Request: All check over and give feedback and check.
  * Other site designs that inspire: Request: all contribute
  * Cornerstone content: Request: Someone to organise a list of what exactly this content is.

### User migration

  * Near completion.
  * We will reduce the information requested from users. There is no point requesting so much information from people such as bios that will only go out of date and never be updated. So as an example only Board and working group members would be requested to add a bio.
  * Lots of old information is out of date or not validated.
  * Will introduce validation on any new information: ORCID, Twitter handles, Linkedin user names, Country, Geolocation.
  * Making a staged moderation process.

### Technology and infrastructure

Large parts in place. Managed Wordpress host, CiviCRM, CDN, etc.
